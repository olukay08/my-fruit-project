                        <P>Lowers cholesterol: Papayas are rich in fibre, Vitamin C and antioxidants that prevent cholesterol build up in your arteries. Too much cholesterol can block the arteries completely, causing a heart attack. Papaya extracts have also found to reduce lipid and triglycerides in diabetic rats.

                            Helps weight loss: One medium sized papaya contains just 120 calories. So, if you’re planning to lose weight, don’t forget to add this light fruit to your diet. Besides, it also packed with a considerable amount of dietary fibre that aids weight loss by promoting a feeling of fullness.
                            
                            Boosts your immunity: Your immune system acts as a shield against various infections that can make you really sick. A single papaya can fulfil more than 200 per cent of your daily requirement of Vitamin C, making it great to build a stronger immune system.
                            
                            Protects against arthritis: Arthritis can be a really debilitating disease and people who have it may find their quality of life reduced significantly.
                            
                            Eating papayas are good for your bones as they have anti-inflammatory properties along with Vitamin C which helps in keeping various forms of arthritis at bay. A study published in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases showed that people who consumed foods low in Vitamin C were three times more likely to have arthritis than those who didn’t</P>

                        <p class="polo">Pineapples are packed with a variety of vitamins and minerals. 
                            They are especially rich in vitamin C and manganese.Antioxidants are molecules that help your body combat oxidative stress.

                            Oxidative stress is a state in which there are too many free radicals in the body. These free radicals interact with the body’s
                             cells and cause damage that is linked to chronic inflammation,
                             a weakened immune system and many harmful diseases.
                             Pineapples are especially rich in antioxidants known as flavonoids and phenolic acids (7Trusted Source).

                            What’s more, many of the antioxidants in pineapple are bound. This allows the antioxidants to survive harsher conditions
                           in the body and produce longer lasting effects.For example, one study showed that participants with pancreatic insufficiency experienced better digestion after taking a digestive enzyme supplement containing bromelain, compared to taking the same digestive enzyme supplement without bromelain (14Trusted Source).

                           Bromelain is also widely used as a commercial meat tenderizer due to its ability to break down tough meat proteins

                        <p class="polo">Even though cashews can be considered high fat, they are not rich in the kind that is generally bad for you. Instead, it increases the production of fatty acids which are important for developing the brain and clotting of the blood. 

                            The average consumption of cashew aids in controlling the cholesterol level and maintains blood pressure
                            Cashew fruits contain compounds known as proanthocyanins, which are a class of flavonols that suppresses cancer cell replication. This is an important function, as once cancer cell replication starts, it quickly becomes difficult to get a hold of, and explains why a shotgun approach is often employed when treating cancer-hurting good cells in the process. Plus, cashews are rich in copper, a mineral that reduces cell propensity to mutate, 
                            and shows particular promise in managing and preventing colon cancer
                        
                             Due to its high level of lutein and zeaxanthin, it is an excellent food for the eyes. They are very effective in promoting healthy eyes and also preventing your eyes from been damages by harmful radiations of sun rays and also

                            Apples are also a rich source of polyphenols, an important group of antioxidants. Antioxidants are compounds that protect your cells from free radicals — harmful molecules that contribute to the development of chronic conditions,

Antioxidants are compounds that protect your cells from free radicals — harmful molecules that contribute to the development of chronic conditions, like heart disease and cancer (4Trusted Source).

                            While nutrition labels don’t list these plant compounds, they’re likely responsible for many of apples’ health benefits (1Trusted Source)
                            
                            To get the most out of apples, leave the skin on, as it contains half of the fiber and most of the polyphenols (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).
                            Apples are high in fiber and water, two qualities that make them filling.

                             An increasing feeling of fullness works as a weight-loss strategy, as it helps manage your appetite. This, in turn, might lead you to reduce your energy intake (9Trusted Source).

Potassium can help manage blood pressure and reduce strain on the cardiovascular system.

                            A medium banana provides almost 9% of a person’s daily potassium needs, according to the nutritional information 
                            from the above sources.Bananas contain fiber, potassium, folate, and antioxidants, such as vitamin C. All of these support heart health.

                            A 2017 reviewTrusted Source found that people who follow a high fiber diet have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those on a low fiber diet. Those who consumed more fiber also had lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol
                            Bananas contain water and fiber, both of which promote regularity and encourage digestive health. One medium banana provides approximately 10% of a person’s fiber needs for a day.
